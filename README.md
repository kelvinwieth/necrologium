### Branching system

This repository uses the **trunk-based** system. To open a PR, we usually do:

1. `git checkout master && git pull`
2. `git checkout -b fix/my-bugfix`
3. Work and commit
4. `git push -u origin fix/my-bugfix`
5. Open a PR from `fix/my-bugfix` to `master`
6. After approved, do a **squash commit**
7. And the branch `fix/my-bugfix` is deleted
